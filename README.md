# BlockPhysics 0.92b
Block Physics mod, originally created by id_miner

NEW THIS UPDATE: Sliding!

Many, many things still unimplemented. Currently supports downward movement and sliding. Sturcture checks should be properly working. Configuration working. Mod compatability untested. 

License: Don't be a jerk. Keep things open source. Don't try to make money off of it. You have no rights over code added via pull request, don't try to be like Wolvereness. Otherwise I most likely don't care. I don't just give you permission to add to modpacks, I demand it!
