# BlockPhysics 0.93b
Block Physics mod, originally created by id_miner

NEW THIS UPDATE:

More defaults added to the config.

Minor logic updates.

Many, many things still unimplemented. Currently supports downward movement and sliding. Sturcture checks should be properly working. Configuration working. Mod compatability untested. 

License: Don't be a jerk. Keep things open source. Don't try to make money off of it. You have no rights over code added via pull request, don't try to be like Wolvereness. Otherwise I most likely don't care. I don't just give you permission to add to modpacks, I demand it!
