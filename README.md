# BlockPhysics 0.93b
Block Physics mod, originally created by id_miner

NEW THIS UPDATE:

Fixed config not accepting blocks without metadata.

Fixed max life timer of falling blocks. Should significantly cut down on the number of blocks being dropped as items.

Removed client side requirement. Can now run on servers without being on the client. Causes minor visual errors on client without mod, but works fine.

Added "hurts" option to BlockDef. Controls falling block damage.

Many, many things still unimplemented. Currently supports downward movement and sliding. Sturcture checks should be properly working. Configuration working. Mod compatability untested. 

License: Don't be a jerk. Keep things open source. Don't try to make money off of it. You have no rights over code added via pull request, don't try to be like Wolvereness. Otherwise I most likely don't care. I don't just give you permission to add to modpacks, I demand it!
