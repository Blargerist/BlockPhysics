# BlockPhysics 0.9b
Block Physics mod, originally created by id_miner

Many, many things still unimplemented. Currently only supports downward movement, no sliding. Sturcture checks should be properly working. Configuration working. Mod compatability untested. 

WARNING: Laggy, I've not made any attempts at optimization yet.

License: Don't be a jerk. Keep things open source. Don't try to make money off of it. You have no rights over code added via pull request, don't try to be like Wolvereness. Otherwise I most likely don't care. I don't just give you permission to add to modpacks, I demand it!
